   * busy any one of them is, so a quiet tenant pays for everyone else
   * being online.
   *
   * Null is treated as "not ready yet" and nothing is subscribed:
   * subscribing unfiltered while the account id loads would reintroduce
   * exactly the fan-out this exists to avoid, on every page load.
